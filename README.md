This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

This project was made by react doc. It is a good way to understand some basic react principles, like state and props.

It is a tic tac toe game! A fun way to understand.

We could think that everything is a component and it is made that way to simplify complex projects. The **state** is considered private to the component in which it is defined.
